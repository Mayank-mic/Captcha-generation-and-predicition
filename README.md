## Introduction

CAPTCHAs (Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart) are used as a security measure to prevent automated bots from accessing or abusing websites. The "Captcha.py" script in this repository demonstrates how to generate CAPTCHAs and use a machine learning model to predict and recognize the characters in the CAPTCHAs.

## Installation

To use the "Captcha.py" script, you need to have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you'll need the following libraries:

- NumPy
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow

You can install these dependencies using pip:

pip install numpy opencv-python tensorflow



## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Mayank-mic/Captcha-generation-and-predicition.git


2. Navigate to the project directory:

cd Captcha-generation-and-predicition


3. Run the "Captcha.py" script:

python Captcha.py


4. The script will generate a set of CAPTCHAs, train a machine learning model on the dataset, and then use the model to predict and recognize characters in the generated CAPTCHAs.

## Features

- Generation of CAPTCHAs using OpenCV.
- Training a machine learning model to recognize CAPTCHA characters using TensorFlow.
- Prediction of characters in CAPTCHAs using the trained model.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model is not included in this repository. However, you can generate your own dataset using the "Captcha.py" script or obtain a pre-existing dataset of CAPTCHA images.

## Model Training

The script uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) model for training on the CAPTCHA dataset. You can customize the model architecture and hyperparameters in the "Captcha.py" script to achieve better performance on your dataset.

## Prediction

The trained model is used to predict the characters in the generated CAPTCHAs. The accuracy of the model may vary based on the quality and size of the dataset used for training.
